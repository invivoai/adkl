# Adaptive Deep Kernel Learning

This repository contains the code base for the ADKL paper. It contains the code for multiple baselines to which we compared our algorithm, namely :

* Conditional Neural Processes (CNP)

* Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)

* Bayesian MAML

* Learned Basis Functions

* Proto-MAML
